# pfSense Firewall Setup Project
This project involves the installation and configuration of a pfSense firewall in a virtual machine environment, aimed at enhancing my understanding of network security and firewall management. The primary objective was to create a basic firewall setup that allows and blocks specific traffic, demonstrating the practical application of firewall rules. I successfully installed pfSense in a VM, configured its interfaces, and established connectivity between the pfSense firewall and a Windows virtual machine. Through this process, I learned about essential concepts such as inbound and outbound traffic control, the importance of documentation, and the hands-on experience of managing a firewall. Additionally, I explored various rule configurations, including blocking specific websites, which deepened my knowledge of how firewalls function to protect networks from unauthorized access. The project culminated in a comprehensive Word document detailing each step of the setup process, which serves as both a reference for future configurations and a demonstration of the skills acquired throughout this project. I intend to further expand my knowledge by exploring advanced features of pfSense, including VPN setups and intrusion detection systems (IDS).
